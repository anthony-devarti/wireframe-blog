# Week 6

## Intro
We covered a lot of concepts during the second week of in-person learning.  We really focused on API calls and how to get outside data into your code.  This really provided a lot of real-world application opportunities for some of the building block concepts that we had already covered.  We got even more practice using the concepts from last week and applying them to new materail.  

## What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

The importance of being able to pull in data from other sources can't be overstated.  Once you are able to build on top of existing, known-good, code and information, the ability to build increasingly complex tools and pages expands massively.  

## What does it mean to develop good code?

Good code is code that is readable by others, scalable, so you can grow and expand it later, and gets you from point a to point b in as few lines of code as your current skill level allows.  That last point is one that I want to explain in a bit more detail.  Put simply, what was "good code" for me a week ago, is not the same as what "good code" would look like for me today.  Today's "good" won't look "good" next week, and that week's "good" won't look "good" the week after that.  As long as my skill level is growing, past projects *should* look worse and worse as time goes on. That just gives more opporunities for refactoring.

## What does it mean to be a good developer?

A good developer is one that is never content with their current skill level.  The subject matter is too big, too frequently updating, and real-world applications too nebulous to ever execute truly perfectly.  That means that there is always something to refactor, always something to improve, and always something new to learn.  Being willing to exist in that state of constant growth makes for a good developer.  Any given project may be "good enough" to ship, once it meets the requirements of it, but the developer who wrote it should never be "good enough" to close themselves off to new concepts, techniques, or methods.

## What is one thing that programmers hate doing?

Repeating themselves, repeating themselves, repeating themselves.
