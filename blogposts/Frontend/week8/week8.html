                            <h2> you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?</h2>
                            I wouldn't call Javascript libraries easy to use just yet.  Every step I take in javascript feels like it takes a lot of effort, with or without libraries at the moment, regardless of the simplicity or complexity of the logic problem before me.  If I were asked to accomplish a simple task in javascript, I'm confident I could do so, but it would take more time, more effort, and take up more mental bandwidth than I would like.  The use of frameworks and libaraies gives me the ability scale up to working on more complex tasks.  Having these skills built up in anticipation of these more complex tasks is exciting!  I'm really looking forward to the point where the simpler tasks become more automatic, and I can really start taking advantage of these advanced libraries.
                            
                             <h2> Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about? </h2>
                            I'm especially interested in getting deeper into react.  I see it everywhere, and this week's intial teaser demonstrated just how powerful it can be at acomplishing common tasks and frequent client requests.
                            
                            <h2>Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.</h2>
                            Something that seems like it might be interesting and useful is automation tools.  A newish one that seems interesting is nutjs, which I bookmarked after seeing it featured on npm.
