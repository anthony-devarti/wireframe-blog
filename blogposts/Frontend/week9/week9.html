                                <h2> What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
                                The past week, I made the commitment to use the gitpod gui less and use CLIs more.  gitpod may be what we are using throughout the bootcamp, but CLIs are relevant no matter what I am doing.  I'd like to use them sooner rather than later.  As for whether or not they're scary?  Yeah, a bit.  We're all transitioning away from our roles as pure consumers of this type of content, and consumers expect a GUI.  There's a disconnect between what is being typed and what is going to happen that can only be reduced by using them.  Still, it's a bit scary to have so much effort be at the whim of 20 characters or less in the command line.
                                </h2>
                                <h2> If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
                                This is a tricky question, since you don't know what you don't know.  Finding out that a CLI command on my wishlist already exists would probably be a net positive, if a bit embarassing.  My wishlist right now is a command that would list out commands that I might want to take followed by a definition of what they do.  I think that would be helpful and would make me far less tempted to pick up the mouse and use the gitpod gui if I'm doing something following a particularly tough session.
                                </h2>
                                <h2> List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code
                                Basically anything that would require a lot of common code.  Since frameworks have libraries to take care of a lot of the boilerplate code, anything that needs to be repeated a lot goes much more quickly when you are using a framework versus coding out everything from the start!
