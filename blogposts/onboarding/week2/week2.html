                          <p> What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?</h2>
                          Something I would like to be able to do is to make a simple, web-based tool or application that would serve some sort of function.  
                          Something small like a dice roller web page.  I find small side projects like this provide a consequence free canvas for me to 
                          experiment and test new techniques or lessons on, and would likely grow more complicated over time.</p>
                        
                          
                          <h2> What are you struggling with?</h2>
                          <p>One struggle that I keep finding myself running into seems to be surrounding vocabulary.  When I come across a word or concept 
                          that I don't recognize, I look up that word, which often leads down a rabbit hole of more content that is new to me.  This can 
                          cause reading documentation or descriptions to become very involved, very quickly, as each term can lead to an exponentially 
                          increasing amount of content to consume, where one new term leads to three, which each lead to three new terms, each of which 
                          lead to three new terms. .  It's all very interesting, but I have looked at the clock after getting 4 layers deep and realize 
                          that I have spent an hour on a single sentence!</p>
                        
                          
                          <h2> How do you solve a problem?</h2>
                          <p>I read.  A lot.  If I run into an issue, I find a resource (skill growth has and will continue to help me to recognize and find 
                          good, reliable resources more quickly), and dive in.  After reading, I dive in and start experimenting to try to apply the reading.</p>
                        
                          
                          <h2> What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?</h2>
                            <p>If I find myself stuck, I try to give myself another task to work on.  I like to keep a running to-do list at all times, and if I 
                          can't complete one task, I will try to get it to a stable, fresh starting point, then move onto something else.  When I come back, 
                          I can try to apply "fresh eyes" to the problem and that can help me look at it from another angle.  I also try to think of other 
                          places I have seen this successfully implemented, and look to see how it was addressed there.  If I look at a few places and find 
                          that multiple are solving the problem the same way, I do a deep dive in reading about that solution, to see if I can understand why 
                          it was used, how it works, and if that solution is applicable to my situation.</p>
